## Introduction
I’m Qingqing Tan, a bioinformatics graduate student at Northeastern University with a strong interest in genomics,
data analysis, and translational biology. I enjoy solving complex problems, integrating computational and experimental
perspectives, and maintaining balance through fitness, discipline, and continuous learning.
